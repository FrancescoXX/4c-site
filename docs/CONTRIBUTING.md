[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <4c.contactus@gmail.com>.

## I don"t want to read this whole thing. I just have a question!!!

To ask questions, open a [discussion][discussion].
Use the help category to ask questions. Make sure to search for existing
discussions before you do so.

## How can I contribute?

You can help us fix issues by reporting bugs. To learn more, read [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs).

You can also submit ideas for enhancements. To learn more, read [Suggesting enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements).

You can also help by tackling [issues]. To learn more, read [Your first code contribution](#your-first-code-contribution)

### Reporting bugs

> **If you want to report a security vulnerability, do not open an issue for it!** > **Send an email to <4c.contactus@gmail.com>, and you will receive instructions from there**
>
> Also, check out [The security guidelines](./SECURITY.md)

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the site.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your issue,
reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before writing a bug report, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report)
as you might find out that you don"t need to create one. When create
a bug report, please [include as much information as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).
Fill out [the required template][new-issue]. The information it asks
for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Perform a search on GitHub and Google** to see if this has happened before.
  If it has, comment on the issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues][issues]. Create an issue on the repository
and provide the following information by filling in the [template][new-issue].

**Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:**

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem. Title it `"[Bug]: Title here"`.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
  For example, start by explaining how you got to the website, what your network speed is,
  etc. When listing steps, don"t just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
  For example: if you clicked a button, explain if you used the mouse or a the keyboard.
  And if you used the keyboard, which key?
- **Describe the behavior** you observed after following the steps and point out
  **what exactly is the problem** with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected** to see instead and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps
  and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following
  the steps, record the GIF with a keybinding visualizer like [Keycastr][keycastr].
  You can use [this tool][licecap] to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and
  [this tool][silentcast] on Linux.
- If the problem wasn"t triggered by a specific action,
  **describe what you were doing before the problem happened** and share more
  information using the guidelines below.

**Provide more context by answering these questions:**

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (after the site was updated)
  or, was this always a problem?
  - If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce it in an older version**
    of the site? What"s the most recent version in which the problem doesn"t happen?
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how
  often the problem happens\*\* and under which conditions it usually happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- What"s the **name and version of the OS** you"re using?

## Suggesting enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the site,
including new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your
suggestion and find related reports.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion)
as you might find out that you don"t need to create one. When you create
an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).
Fill in [the template][new-issue], including the steps that you imagine
you would take if the feature you"re requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Perform a search on GitHub and Google** to see if the enhancement has already
  been suggested. If it has, comment on the existing issue instead of
  opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues][issues].
Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/paste-able
  snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps
  or point out the part of the site which the suggestion is related to.
  If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with a
  keybinding visualizer like [Keycastr][keycastr]. You can use [this tool][licecap]
  to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool][silentcast] on Linux.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be helpful** to most The 4C Site users.
- **List some other projects** where this enhancement exists.

### Your first code contribution

Want to help but are not sure what to do? You can go through the [issues][issues],
or go to the [contributing page][contributing].

Or, you can look through these [Good first issues: ](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue++repo%3AfrancescoXX%2F4c-site+sort%3Acomments-desc&type=issues)

The issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect, it gives a reasonable idea of the impact a given change will have.

### Local Development

If you see a bug in The 4C Site, or just want to experiment with it, you can
get a local copy of the code and start playing with it.

To get a local copy, follow these steps:

1.  **Forking the [repo]**.

    You can follow the [GitHub help instructions to do so](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

2.  **Cloning and setting up**

    Once you have a fork, you can clone it:

    ```console
    you@computer$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/4c-site.git
    ```

    Next, you can navigate to your clone:

    ```console
    you@computer$ cd 4c-site
    ```

    And you can install dependencies by running:

    ```console
    you@computer$ npm install
    ```

    Now, you are ready to start hacking!

#### Running

You can start a dev server by running:

```console
you@computer$ npm run dev
```

This will load a lightweight, hot reloading server. All changes
will be reflected automatically.

#### Building

To build the code, run:

```console
you@computer$ npm run build
```

This will use nextjs to build the code.

<!-- #### Testing

Tests are located in the `/tests` folder. After writing your code, you can run tests by running:

```console
you@computer$ npm run test
```

We use {test-framework} to write tests. -->

### Pull requests

If you have made any changes to the code and you want to add the changes to the site, you can open a PR.

You can follow the [GitHub pull request tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
If you don"t know how to open a Pull Request or what a Pull Request is.

Before you open a Pull Request:

- Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
- Write tests
- Follow the instructions in the Pull request"s template
- After you open the Pull request, make sure all status checks are passing

## Styleguides

### Git commit messages

- Use the present tense ("Add this..", not "Added this...")
- Use the imperative mood ("Do this...", not "Does this...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Consider starting your commit messages with an applicable [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev):
